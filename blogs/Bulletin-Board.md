Web Design is fabulous for me, because I can show whatever fantastic in the web. What I wanted to creat is a bulletin board. Therefore, I began my creating work using Javascript.

### Design Web Style
The first thing I need to do is design the style of bulletin board using CSS. I designed background color and size. Then I constructed the style of note. Finally, I designed the color of every button, which was used in the bulletin board.

### Using React.js to design an UI
I plan to use Javascript to complete my project, since one of the libraries of Javascript--react.js is really convienient to use. What's more important is react is very efficient and flexible. Firstly, I creat the board, which is used to show the notes. I designed two main functions, adding notes and displaying notes. After I had a board, I began to create note. There are three functions of notes, which are removing notes, editing information and save information. Finally, To make my bulletin board more beatiful, I used a random number to choose the position of every notes.

After I finised my bulletin board, I deployed it on my github pages. Now, everyone can use the link to open my bulletin board, and can use it. Here is the link.
